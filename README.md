![Processing Data Sources in PHP][lil-thumbnail-url] 

PHP is used on approximately 80% of all websites, and it’s a powerful programming language on its own. But its real power comes from the ability to retrieve and process data. In this course, Joe Casabona explains how PHP’s powerful feature set makes it the perfect language to work with virtually any data source. Joe shows you how to use PHP to read from, and write to, various data sources, from flat files to databases to robust web services. If you’re interested in learning how to build a web application using just about any data source available to you, join Joe in the course to see how PHP can help you do just that.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
